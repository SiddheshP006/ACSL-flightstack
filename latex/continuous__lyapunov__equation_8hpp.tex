Description\+: Computes the solution of the continuos Lyapunov equation WARNING !!! The following code uses a different convention than MATLAB\textquotesingle{}s. This code solves the equation\+: {\ttfamily AᵀX + XA + Q = 0} MATLAB command \char`\"{}lyap(\+A, Q)\char`\"{} solves the equation\+: {\ttfamily AX + XAᵀ + Q = 0} So this code provides the same result as obtained in MATLAB using the command\+: lyap(A\textquotesingle{}, Q) !!!!!!!!!!!

Q is a symmetric matrix.

Computes a unique solution X to the continuous Lyapunov equation\+: {\ttfamily AᵀX + XA + Q = 0}, where A is real and square, and Q is real, symmetric and of equal size as A. 
\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em std\+::runtime\+\_\+error} & if A or Q are not square matrices or do not have the same size.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyExceptions}
Limitations\+: Given the Eigenvalues of A as λ₁, ..., λₙ, there exists a unique solution if and only if λᵢ + λ̅ⱼ ≠ 0 ∀ i,j, where λ̅ⱼ is the complex conjugate of λⱼ. 
\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em std\+::runtime\+\_\+error} & if the solution is not unique.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyExceptions}
There are no further limitations on the eigenvalues of A. Further, if all λᵢ have negative real parts, and if Q is positive semi-\/definite, then X is also positive semi-\/definite \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}. Therefore, if one searches for a Lyapunov function V(z) = zᵀ\+Xz for the stable linear system ż = Az, then the solution of the Lyapunov Equation {\ttfamily AᵀX + XA + Q = 0} only returns a valid Lyapunov function if Q is positive semi-\/definite.

The implementation is based on SLICOT routine SB03\+MD \mbox{[}2\mbox{]}. Note the transformation Q = -\/C. The complexity of this routine is O(n³). If A is larger than 2-\/by-\/2, then a Schur factorization is performed. 
\begin{DoxyExceptions}{Exceptions}
{\em std\+::runtime\+\_\+error} & if Schur factorization failed.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyExceptions}
A tolerance of ε is used to check if a double variable is equal to zero, where the default value for ε is 1e-\/10. It has been used to check (1) if λᵢ + λ̅ⱼ = 0, ∀ i,j; (2) if A is a 1-\/by-\/1 zero matrix; (3) if A\textquotesingle{}s trace or determinant is 0 when A is a 2-\/by-\/2 matrix.
